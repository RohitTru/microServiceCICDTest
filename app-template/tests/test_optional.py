Optional Tests
============

These tests are nice-to-have and represent additional quality checks.
They may not always pass but provide valuable insights for improving the system.

When to Use Optional Tests:
------------------------
1. Performance optimization
2. Load testing
3. Edge case handling
4. UI/UX improvements
5. Documentation verification
6. Resource usage monitoring

How to Write Optional Tests:
-------------------------
1. Focus on non-critical improvements
2. Use soft assertions where appropriate
3. Include detailed logging
4. Make tests configurable
5. Handle test failures gracefully

Example Use Cases:
----------------
1. Response time optimization
2. Concurrent user simulation
3. Memory usage monitoring
4. Edge case handling
5. UI responsiveness
6. API documentation accuracy

Note: All tests below are commented out by default.
These tests should not block deployments but provide valuable feedback.
